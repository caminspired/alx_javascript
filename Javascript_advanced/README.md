**JAVASCRIPT ADVANCED (PROJECT 29 | WEEK 13)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning about closures, lexical scoping and other advanced JS concepts.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this project are to understand what lexical scoping and closures are. How to simulate private methods with closures, executenstack orders bind and use callbacks with JavaScript.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Lexical scoping and welcome message(11pts)
1. Closure Scope Chain(19pts)
2. Closure(13pts)
3. Closure and loops(12pts)
4. Complex Closure(17pts)
5. Changing DOM with closure(26pts)
6. Private methods with closure(19pts)
7. Stack order and setTimeout(6pts)

# MANUAL REVIEW

Once this is complete, we will need to show that we are ready for review by selecting the "Ready for my review" tab to enable our peers to review us. Note that, without a manual review the project isincomplete and there will be no grade awarded. You would also need to put in time to review a peer, as it is only right to give what been given to you.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
