**JAVASCRIPT - NETWORK (PROJECT 28 | WEEK 13)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning about JavaScript APIs, JSON and other modules.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this project are to understand why JavaScript programming is amazing, how to manipulate JSON data, how to use request and fetch API, and, how to read and write a file using fs module.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Status code(8pts)
1. Star wars movie title(8pts)
2. Star wars Wedge Antilles(9pts)
3. Loripsum(9pts)
4. How many completed?(10pts)
5. Who was playing in this movie?(9pts)

# REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION
