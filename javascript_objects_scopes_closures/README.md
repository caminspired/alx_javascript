**JAVASCRIPT - OBJECTS, SCOPES, AND, CLOSURES (PROJECT 27 | WEEK 12)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning about JavaScript objects, classes and closure are.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this project are to understand why JavaScript programming is amazing, how to create an object, what 'this' and undefined mean in javascript. We will also try to underestand why the variable type and scope is important, what closure and prototype are, and how to inherit an object from anothermodule.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Rectangle #0(6pts)
1. Rectangle #1(10pts)
2. Rectangle #2(10pts)
3. Rectangle #3(10pts)
4. Rectangle #4(10pts)
5. Square #0(10pts)
6. Square #1(10pts)

# REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
