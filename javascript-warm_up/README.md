**JAVASCRIPT - WARM UP (PROJECT 26 | WEEK 12)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning about JavaScript as a programming language, what it can be used for and the basics.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this project are to understand how to run JavaScript file, create variables and the differences between var, let and const. We will also go into the different data types, if, if else and else statements, while and for loops and varies basic js concepts.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. First constant, first print(5pts)
1. 3 languages(5pts)
2. Loop to languages(10pts)
3. Object(6pts)
4. Add file(7pts)
5. Const or not const(6pts)
6. Call me Moby(7pts)
7. Add me maybe(7pts)
8. Increment object(6pts)

# REVIEW

Like the previous project, each task would need to be reviewed by the automatic checker on the intranet, so once a task is complete, proceed to click on the "check your code" button to receive a score. Please note, you will not receive a score until all fails are corrected and cleared by the checker.

# CONCLUSION

I hope this has been an insightful README and you have all the information needed to navigative this directory. If not, let me know in the comments and I will make the necessary modifications. Do not forget to check out the resources referenced below.
