**HTML FORM + JS VALIDATION (PROJECT 33 | WEEK 15)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be creating and validatingforms using HTML and JavaScript.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this project are to understand what client-side validation is, how to implement basic form validation using JavaScript, how to handle form submissions and how perform data validation using JavaScript.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Form Validation - Password Strength(14pts)
1. Form Validation - Email Validation(13pts)
2. Dynamic Form Field(20pts)
3. Form Submission Handling(14pts)

# REVIEW

Once this is complete, we will need to show that we are ready for review by selecting the "Ready for my review" tab to enable our peers to review us. Note that, without a manual review the project isincomplete and there will be no grade awarded. You would also need to put in time to review a peer, as it is only right to give what been given to you.
