**JS HTML DOM MANIPULATION (PROJECT 30 | WEEK 14)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning on DOM, HTML manipulation with JS and working with event listeners.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this project are to understand the Document Object Model (DOM), access, and, manipulate elements with JavaScript. We are also going to learn how to use CSS selectors and traverse the DOM tree. And then finally, how to work with event listeners/handlers.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Play with the DOM(11pts)
1. Selecting HTML Elements Using Selectors(11pts)
2. Modifying Element Content, Attributes, and Styles(6pts)
3. Creating, Appending, and Removing Elements(7pts)

# REVIEW

Once this is complete, we will need to show that we are ready for review by selecting the "Ready for my review" tab to enable our peers to review us. Note that, without a manual review the project isincomplete and there will be no grade awarded. You would also need to put in time to review a peer, as it is only right to give what been given to you.

# CONCLUSION
