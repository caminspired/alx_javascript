**COOKIES & LOCAL STORAGE (PROJECT 31 | WEEK 14)**

# INTRODUCTION/OVERVIEW

For this week, we will be learning about the very famous and feared cookies. With cookies, comes ANTS!.

# LEARNING OBJECTIVES

The main objectives of this project are to understand how to create cookies, how to set specific settings for the cookies, and, how to read cookies with Javascript.
We would also learn how to use js-cookie for easy cookie manipulation, how to use the browser web storage, and, the differences between local storage and session storage.

# TASKS

The following tasks will need to be completed and checked with the in-built intranet code checker;

0. Create basic cookie(17pts)
1. Create cookie with expiration date and specific path(5pts)
2. Read cookie(7pts)
3. Delete cookie and mini application(22pts)
4. Use js-cookie(8pts)
5. Local storage(23pts)
6. Session storage(15pts)
7. Advanced use of web storage(42pts)

# REVIEW

Once this is complete, we will need to show that we are ready for review by selecting the "Ready for my review" tab to enable our peers to review us. Note that, without a manual review the project isincomplete and there will be no grade awarded. You would also need to put in time to review a peer, as it is only right to give what been given to you.
